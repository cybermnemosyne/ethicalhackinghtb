# On Your Own

Buffer overflows is not a particularly simple concept and it involves knowing some assembly and becoming proficient using a debugger of some sort. Any practice in these areas is going to be worthwhile. On Hack The Box, the machine Jail has a buffer overflow as its starting point and so that is a good machine to try, at least to the point of getting a reverse shell with the buffer overflow. The box is a Linux box and is running a web server. Running gobuster reveals a directory /jailuser that has a directory /dev and that has files in it. The source code is for a program jail that is likely listening on port 7411. The program source code for jail reveals a buffer overflow. The line of code that is wrong is a string copy that is copying a variable that can be up to 256 bytes long into a variable that is only 16 bytes long. This is a 32 bit program that can be exploited in much the same was as the machine Buff. If you get stuck, Hack The Box provides a writeup of the machine that explains the buffer overflow or watch Ippsec's walkthrough here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80-73OYcrrk&t=910s.
